# Tunnel_ID
TunnelID is a decentralized identity engine for the autonomous internet. It enables both humans and AI agents to authenticate and verify credentials biometrically, pseudonymously, and privately, without disclosing or storing sensitive data.
This demo illustrates how a user can generate cryptographic keys using their facial data.
